# Solving problem VirtualBox: Error supR3HardenenWinReSpawn - launching VirtualBox VM process: 5

Recently had a problem with VirtualBox. When was trying to start a VM already created or some new VM, an error was presented:

```
Error in supR3HardenenWinReSpawn
Error in relaunching VirtualBox VM process: 5
rc=-104
```

I tried several solutions and none worked. 
The only solution that worked was to go back to the version of VirtualBox for 4.3.12 (https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.12/)

To access VirtualBox versions:

Hope this helps!
